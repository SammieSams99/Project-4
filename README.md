# Project-4



“Do you remember the name of the wine you bought two weeks ago? You know the one your friend Rebecca recommended? No? Darn”

This has happened to me a few times and I realized there’s a really simple solution. Wine journals exist but who wants to go to a dinner party carrying around a bulky journal and looking a bit like a lush? What if there were a way to bring your journal with you anywhere you go? Dinner parties, restaurants, your friends place or even in the comfort of your own home.

With Daily Wine you can make your wine journal mobile! Log your favorite wine, it’s region of origin, their tasting notes and much more! Daily Wine makes it easier to quickly log, store and share your wine experiences before you forget about them.
